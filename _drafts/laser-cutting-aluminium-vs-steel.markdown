I saw this [great guide][low power stencils] on making your own aluminium solder stencils from soda cans a few months ago and decided to give it a go for my [operon][operon] board. I won't rehash all of the steps, Felix has done a great job of that. I'll just cover the stuff I learnt while giving it a go.

### Toner transfer
Finding a reliable medium for toner transfer was a little difficult. Felix suggests transparency film or shelving vinyl. After trying a few different things I ended up using book contact from Woolworths (I think it is very similar to the shelving vinyl).
