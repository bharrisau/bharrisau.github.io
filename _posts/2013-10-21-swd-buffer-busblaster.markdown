I put together a quick project to make a KT-Link compatible buffer for my [BusBlaster v3](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Mathieu_:_Bus_Blaster_v3). The repo is [here](https://github.com/bharrisau/busblaster), and background and programming instructions is available [here](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Blaster_buffer_logic).

Next step is finding a urJtag or OpenOCD version that supports KT-Link SWD.
