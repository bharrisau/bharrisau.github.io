I'm practising the skill of memorising a deck of cards. Hopefully by logging my progress I'll keep at it long enough to make it a habit.

**Result 5:** Stored 44 cards in 10 minutes. Recalled 82%.

### Notes

I'm getting quicker - I tried a different way of thumbing through the cards. I hold the deck with the bottom card facing me (and flip it over so I can't see it), then I push the top two cards to the left. I got two wrong because an image from yesterday took over today's one (I probably didn't anchor today's one properly). And the rest of the times I either confused myself with the image (still dealing with hard actions like "warp speed" and "cartoon running"), or didn't anchor properly.
