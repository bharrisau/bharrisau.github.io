I'm practising the skill of memorising a deck of cards. Hopefully by logging my progress I'll keep at it long enough to make it a habit.

**Result 4:** Stored 38 cards in 10 minutes. Recalled 100%.

### Notes

Much better today. Properly anchoring into the loci this time. There were one or two that I was lucky to get, and I forgot to put an image in a loci. Still very slow shifting the thinking from memory (what do the cards mean), to imagery/storage. I expect as I do it more I will tokenise the cards into images automatically, and I can stay in imagery more the whole time.
