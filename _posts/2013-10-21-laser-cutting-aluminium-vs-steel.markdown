I like to have rough figures for how common things stack up against each other. I'm designing some laser cut pieces for a 3D printer I'm working on, and I have to choose between aluminium and carbon steel. the long and short of it is, when comparing 3mm aluminium to 2mm carbon steel; the aluminium weight half, costs twice as much and is marginally stiffer (~15% more resistant to deflection/bending).
