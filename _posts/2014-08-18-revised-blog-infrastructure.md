title: Revised blog infrastructure
---

I've just moved my blog from a manual build to a Travis build. This should hopefully allow me to use Prose.io to edit the posts and maybe actually get more posts out.

Stranger things have happend.

Edit: Re-push as Travis didn't like the lack of config file in master.

Edit2: Another try.
